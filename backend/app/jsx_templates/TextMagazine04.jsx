        Throughout human history, philosophers have grappled with the nature of
        time. Is it linear or cyclical? Does it flow uniformly, or does our
        perception shape its passage?

        Modern physics has revealed that time is far more complex than our
        everyday experience suggests. Einstein's theory of relativity showed us
        that time is relative, dependent on motion and gravity.

        Yet for all our scientific understanding, time remains deeply personal.
        It is in the quiet moments of reflection that we truly comprehend its
        value.
