        In the realm of human expression, few arts are as powerful and enduring
        as storytelling. From ancient cave paintings to modern digital
        narratives, stories have been the cornerstone of human communication and
        cultural preservation.

        Every great story begins with a spark of imagination, a moment of
        inspiration that transforms ordinary experiences into extraordinary
        tales. The craft lies not just in what we tell, but in how we choose to
        tell it.
      </p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: "1.125rem", lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
        Whether through written word, spoken narrative, or visual medium,
        storytelling remains our most fundamental way of making sense of the
        world around us.
